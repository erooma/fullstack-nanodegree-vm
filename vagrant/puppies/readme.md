## Catalog application submission/Udacity
AdoptUsDogs - -- implementation of a catalog system
23/01/2016 Andrew Moore

These files create an application that stores information about animal shelters 
and their canine occupants. Standard users must sign in to the application
using their Google account (as a means of offering strict security precautions)
and may view, add or adopt puppies as necessary. Administrators have the 
ability to edit both the occupants of the shelters and the information
pertaining to the shelters themselves, while higher privileges allow for
(theoretical) user-management capabilities.

An API endpoint system is in place to obtain information about both puppies 
and shelters through either JSON or XML formats.

### Rudimentary operations

Without signing in, users will be able to see all of the puppies that are 
available for adoption, but only by signing in (through Google) are they
allowed to add puppies, adopt puppies, or edit or remove puppies that they
originally placed into the shelters. Users cannot edit or remove puppies 
that did not originally belong to them. Users can also see a list of puppies
that they adopted - these puppies are essentially removed from all shelters
but their records continue to exist in the database.

The information that can be added for a puppy includes its name, gender,
date of birth, weight (in lbs), special needs and a single image or photo 
(maximum 2 Mbytes) of the puppy in question (this is not obligatory).

### Mid-level operations

Users with more advanced admin privileges have the ability to edit, remove and
transfer all puppies from within the shelters. These users are also allowed to
edit shelter information (address, website, capacity, etc) or add new shelters.
Shelters cannot be filled beyond capacity.

### Highest level users

Users with the highest administration privilegs can see a list of all users in
the system in addition to their adopted puppies.

Choices from all  menus will change depending on the user privileges.

Please note the presence of a *demonstration* option on the main screen
for a user to temporarily change his/her administrator privileges. 
This is for evaluation purposes only, and allows the evaluator to see the 
changes available at each administration level.

* Please note that full user administration (deletion, password reminders etc)
has not been implemented in this version, in part because of the use of the
OAuth2 Google log-in.

### Data options

Within the drop down menus are choices for the user to download data of
either shelters, or puppies within a selected shelter, by means of JSON or
XML coding.

### Known issues

Please note that full user administration (deletion, password reminders etc)
has not been implemented in this version, in part because of the use of the
OAuth2 Google log-in.

This version contains demonstration puppies with images, shelters and
users for evaluation purposes. No similarities with real shelters, dogs, or 
users is implied.

### Requirements

This application is coded in python and uses the frameworks Flask, 
http://flask.pocoo.org/, and the extensions FlaskWTF, 
https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/, and WTForms, 
https://wtforms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

HTML templating uses jquery and bootstrap frameworks.
